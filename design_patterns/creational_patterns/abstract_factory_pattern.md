Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.


Problem
Imagine that you’re creating a furniture shop simulator. Your code consists of classes that represent:

A family of related products, say: Chair + Sofa + CoffeeTable.

Several variants of this family. For example, products Chair + Sofa + CoffeeTable are available in these variants: Modern, Victorian, ArtDeco.

You need a way to create individual furniture objects so that they match other objects of the same family. Customers get quite mad when they receive non-matching furniture.

Also, you don’t want to change existing code when adding new products or families of products to the program. Furniture vendors update their catalogs very often, and you wouldn’t want to change the core code each time it happens.


What is the Abstract Factory Pattern?
The Abstract Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It allows you to create objects that are related to each other, ensuring that the objects created are compatible.

The Abstract Factory pattern is useful when you need to create a suite of related products or objects that belong to the same family but differ slightly depending on the context.

Key Characteristics of the Abstract Factory Pattern
Encapsulation of Object Families: The pattern encapsulates a group of related objects or products that are meant to be used together.
Loose Coupling: The pattern promotes loose coupling by using interfaces to define the relationships between objects, without depending on specific implementations.
Scalability: It’s easy to introduce new families of products by extending the abstract factory and product interfaces.
