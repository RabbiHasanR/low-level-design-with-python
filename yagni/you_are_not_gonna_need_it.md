What is YAGNI?
Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you might need them.

This principle was popularized by developers in the Extreme Programming (XP) community, among them Kent Beck and Ron Jeffries, who advocate for a focus on simplicity and incremental development.

At its heart, YAGNI is about avoiding over-engineering and focusing strictly on the present requirements.

The rationale behind YAGNI is simple: every line of code we write comes with a cost. It needs to be developed, tested, maintained, and understood by other developers.

By adding unnecessary features or over-engineering solutions, we incur additional complexity, which can slow down development, increase the likelihood of bugs, and make the codebase harder to maintain.



Benefits of YAGNI
Reduced waste: By only implementing what's necessary, you avoid wasting time and effort on unnecessary code.

Simplified codebase: YAGNI promotes a lean and simple codebase, making it easier to maintain and update.

Faster development: A laser focus on immediate needs means you get features out the door faster. You're not bogged down by potential "what ifs".

Improved adaptability: With a flexible and modular codebase, you can respond quickly to changing requirements.



When YAGNI Might Be Inappropriate
Like any principle, YAGNI shouldn't be rigidly applied in every situation. There are times when anticipating near-future needs makes sense:

Well-Known Requirements: If you know with high certainty a feature is coming soon, building some basic support upfront might be wise.

Performance-Critical Areas: Sometimes, a less-than-optimal but more general solution is necessary initially to ensure performance targets are met.
