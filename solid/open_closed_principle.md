Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

This means the design of a software entity should be such that you can introduce new functionality or behavior without modifying the existing code since changing the existing code might introduce bugs.



Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
The Open/Closed Principle (OCP) is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design. It states that:

"Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification."

This means that the behavior of a class should be extendable without modifying its existing code. The principle encourages designing software in such a way that adding new functionality involves adding new code rather than altering existing code, which can help prevent introducing bugs and reduces the risk of breaking existing functionality.


Pros of the Open/Closed Principle
Enhances Maintainability: By adhering to OCP, you reduce the likelihood of introducing bugs when adding new features. The existing code remains untouched, minimizing the risk of breaking existing functionality.
Promotes Extensibility: The system can easily be extended with new features or types by adding new classes or modules, without altering the core logic.
Improves Reusability: Classes designed with OCP in mind are often more reusable, as they are decoupled from specific implementations and rely on abstraction.
Facilitates Testing: Since the existing code isnâ€™t modified, regression testing can focus on new features rather than retesting the entire system.


Cons of the Open/Closed Principle
Initial Complexity: Designing a system that adheres to OCP from the start can be more complex. It often requires additional layers of abstraction, which can make the initial design more challenging and time-consuming.
Overhead of Abstraction: Overuse of abstraction (e.g., too many interfaces or abstract classes) can lead to code that is harder to follow and understand. This can also introduce unnecessary complexity in simple systems.
Performance Considerations: In some cases, the additional layers of abstraction can introduce performance overhead. For example, excessive use of polymorphism might result in slower code execution, particularly in performance-critical applications.
Potential Over-Engineering: If not carefully managed, adhering strictly to OCP can lead to over-engineering, where the code becomes more complex than necessary for the task at hand.
