S: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

This means that a class must have only one responsibility.

When a class performs just one task, it contains a small number of methods and member variables making them more usable and easier to maintain.

If a class has multiple responsibilities, it becomes harder to understand, maintain, and modify and 
increases the potential for bugs because changes to one responsibility could affect the others.


Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design. It states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility. This principle is about ensuring that a class or module focuses on a single concern or functionality, making it easier to understand, maintain, and modify.

Why SRP is Important
Maintainability: When a class has a single responsibility, it's easier to update or modify without affecting other parts of the system.
Testability: A class with a single responsibility is easier to test because it has fewer dependencies and less complex behavior.
Reusability: Single-responsibility classes are more likely to be reused because they are focused and not tied to other unrelated concerns.


Benefits of the Refactored Design
Easier Maintenance: Changes to the formatting logic or file-saving logic can be made independently without affecting the Book class.
Better Testability: Each class has a single responsibility, making it easier to write unit tests for each one.
Improved Reusability: The HtmlFormatter and FileManager classes can be reused in other contexts where content formatting or file saving is needed.

drawback and challenges:
1. Increased Number of Classes/Modules
Example: In a large application, you might end up with hundreds of classes, each handling a tiny piece of functionality, which can make it harder to find where certain logic is implemented.

2. Overhead in Coordination Between Classes
Example: Consider a scenario where different parts of a system need to collaborate closely. If these parts are split into many small classes, managing their interactions can become cumbersome.

3. Premature Abstraction
Example: In an agile environment where requirements are constantly evolving, adhering strictly to SRP from the beginning might lead to a system that is over-engineered for its actual needs.

4. Potential Performance Overhead
Example: In a high-frequency trading system, the performance overhead of managing many small objects instead of a single well-optimized class could potentially be an issue.

5. Complexity in Refactoring
Example: A legacy system with classes that have evolved to take on multiple responsibilities might require extensive testing and debugging to safely refactor into SRP-compliant classes.

6. Potential for Over-Engineering
Example: Creating separate classes for every minor responsibility in a simple CRUD application might be unnecessary and could slow down development without providing significant benefits.
