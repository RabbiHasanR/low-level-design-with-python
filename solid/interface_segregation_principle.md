I: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
No client should be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use.

The main idea behind ISP is to prevent the creation of "fat" or "bloated" interfaces that include methods that are not required by all clients.

By segregating interfaces into smaller, more specific ones, clients only depend on the methods they actually need, promoting loose coupling and better code organization.


Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design. It states that:

"Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use."

In simpler terms, the principle suggests that a class should not be required to implement methods it does not need. Instead of one large, general-purpose interface, you should create smaller, more specific interfaces that are tailored to the needs of individual clients.

Why ISP is Important
Reduces Complexity: By breaking down large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones, you reduce the complexity of implementing classes.
Improves Maintainability: Smaller interfaces are easier to understand, implement, and maintain.
Enhances Flexibility: Classes can implement only the interfaces they actually need, making it easier to create flexible and reusable components.




Pros of the Interface Segregation Principle
Reduced Complexity: Smaller, focused interfaces are easier to implement and understand, reducing the cognitive load on developers.
Better Maintainability: When interfaces are small and focused, changes to one interface are less likely to impact unrelated parts of the system.
Enhanced Flexibility: Classes can implement only the interfaces that are relevant to them, leading to more flexible and adaptable designs.
Improved Reusability: Smaller interfaces can be reused across different contexts, leading to more modular and reusable code.


Cons of the Interface Segregation Principle
Increased Number of Interfaces: Adhering to ISP can lead to a proliferation of small interfaces, which might make the system harder to navigate and manage, especially in large projects.
Initial Design Complexity: Designing small, focused interfaces requires careful thought and planning, which can increase the initial complexity of the design process.
Potential for Over-Segmentation: There is a risk of over-segmenting interfaces, leading to an excessive number of small interfaces that might not provide significant benefits over slightly larger, more general interfaces.
