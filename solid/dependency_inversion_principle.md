D: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.

This means that a particular class should not depend directly on another class, but on an abstraction (interface) of this class.

Applying this principle reduces dependency on specific implementations and makes our code more reusable.



Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is one of the five SOLID principles of object-oriented design. It states that:

"High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions."

Additionally:

"Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions."

In simpler terms, the principle suggests that instead of high-level modules (which contain complex logic) depending on low-level modules (which handle details like database access, file handling, etc.), both should depend on abstract interfaces or classes. This helps in decoupling the code and makes it easier to maintain, test, and extend.

Why DIP is Important
Decoupling: DIP reduces the tight coupling between different modules in a system, making the system more modular.
Flexibility: By depending on abstractions rather than concrete implementations, you can easily swap out implementations without affecting the higher-level logic.
Testability: It becomes easier to mock dependencies in unit tests because high-level modules depend on interfaces or abstract classes rather than specific implementations.



Pros of the Dependency Inversion Principle
Decoupling: DIP reduces the tight coupling between high-level and low-level modules, leading to more modular and maintainable code.
Flexibility: The system becomes more flexible, allowing you to change or extend functionality by swapping out implementations without affecting other parts of the system.
Testability: Unit testing becomes easier because dependencies can be easily mocked or replaced with test doubles.
Maintainability: Changes to low-level modules (like repositories or data sources) do not require changes to high-level business logic, reducing the risk of introducing bugs when making changes.


Cons of the Dependency Inversion Principle
Increased Complexity: Introducing abstractions and interfaces can add complexity to the system, making it harder to understand for new developers or in simpler applications where such abstraction may not be necessary.
Overhead in Design: Implementing DIP requires careful design and planning, which can introduce overhead in terms of time and effort, especially in smaller projects where the benefits might not be as significant.
Potential for Over-Engineering: Applying DIP too aggressively can lead to over-engineering, where the system becomes unnecessarily abstracted and harder to work with, particularly for straightforward use cases.
