1. What are the SOLID principles, and why are they important in software development?
What the interviewer is looking for: A clear understanding of each principle and the ability to explain why they matter in creating maintainable, scalable, and robust software.


2. Can you provide an example of when you applied the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) in a real-world project?
What the interviewer is looking for: Practical experience with SRP, the ability to recognize code smells, and the benefits of refactoring towards single responsibility.


3. How would you refactor a class that violates the Open/Closed Principle? Provide an example.
What the interviewer is looking for: Your understanding of OCP and how to implement it in real-world scenarios to make code more extensible and less prone to bugs during modifications.


4. What is the Liskov Substitution Principle, and how would you identify a violation of this principle in code?
What the interviewer is looking for: A deep understanding of LSP, the ability to identify violations, and how to design class hierarchies that respect this principle.

5. Explain the Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) and give an example where implementing this principle improved a system.
What the interviewer is looking for: Your ability to recognize when an interface is doing too much and how to refactor it to follow ISP, thereby improving code clarity and reducing unnecessary dependencies.


6. What is the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP), and how would you apply it in a project?
What the interviewer is looking for: An understanding of how DIP can be used to create more flexible and testable code, and practical experience with implementing it in a real-world project.


7. Can you explain how SOLID principles work together to improve software design?
What the interviewer is looking for: A holistic understanding of SOLID principles and how they collectively contribute to better software architecture.

8. Describe a scenario where you had to balance adhering to SOLID principles with practical constraints like deadlines or performance requirements.
What the interviewer is looking for: Your ability to pragmatically apply SOLID principles, balancing ideal design with real-world constraints.

9. How do you ensure that your adherence to SOLID principles does not lead to over-engineering?
What the interviewer is looking for: Your awareness of the risks of over-engineering and how you apply SOLID principles judiciously to create maintainable, yet simple and efficient code.


10. How would you approach refactoring a legacy codebase to follow SOLID principles?
What the interviewer is looking for: Experience with legacy code, a methodical approach to refactoring, and an understanding of how to incrementally improve a codebase to follow SOLID principles.
