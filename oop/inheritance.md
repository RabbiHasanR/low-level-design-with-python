Inheritance in Python: An Overview
Inheritance is one of the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows you to create a new class that is based on an existing class. The new class (called the child or derived class) inherits attributes and methods from the existing class (called the parent or base class), allowing for code reuse and the creation of more complex systems with less duplication.

Key Concepts of Inheritance
Parent Class (Base Class): The class whose attributes and methods are inherited.
Child Class (Derived Class): The class that inherits attributes and methods from the parent class.
Method Overriding: The ability of the child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class.
super() Function: A function that allows you to call a method from the parent class in the child class.
