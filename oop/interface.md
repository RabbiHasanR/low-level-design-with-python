Interface in Python OOP
In object-oriented programming (OOP), an interface defines a contract that classes must follow. It specifies a set of methods that a class must implement, without providing the implementation itself. This allows different classes to implement the same interface in their own way, ensuring that they can be used interchangeably in certain contexts.

In Python, interfaces are typically implemented using abstract base classes (ABCs) from the abc module. Although Python doesn't have a formal "interface" keyword like some other languages (such as Java), abstract base classes serve the same purpose by enforcing the implementation of certain methods in derived classes.

Key Concepts of Interfaces
Contract: An interface defines a contract that classes must adhere to, specifying what methods they should implement.
Abstraction: Interfaces provide a way to achieve abstraction, where the details of the implementation are hidden, and only the interface is exposed.
Polymorphism: By using interfaces, different classes can be used interchangeably as long as they implement the same interface. This enables polymorphism in Python.
Separation of Concerns: Interfaces help in separating the definition of functionality from its implementation, promoting cleaner and more maintainable code.

Implementing Interfaces in Python
In Python, you can create an interface using an abstract base class. An abstract base class contains one or more abstract methods, which are methods declared but not implemented in the base class. Subclasses of this abstract base class must implement all abstract methods.


When to Use Interfaces
Designing Frameworks: When creating a framework or library, interfaces allow you to define a standard way for users to implement custom functionality.
Ensuring Consistency: Interfaces ensure that different classes adhere to a consistent API, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
Achieving Polymorphism: Interfaces enable polymorphism by allowing different classes to be used interchangeably if they implement the same interface.
Summary
Interface: In Python, an interface is typically implemented using an abstract base class (ABC) that defines a set of methods that must be implemented by any class that inherits from it.
Contract: An interface defines a contract that classes must follow, specifying the methods they should implement without providing the implementation.
Polymorphism: Interfaces allow different classes to be used interchangeably if they implement the same interface, enabling polymorphism.
Real-Life Example: A payment system where different payment methods (e.g., credit card, PayPal, bank transfer) implement a common PaymentMethod interface.
Built-In Example: The collections.abc.Sequence abstract base class in Python defines an interface for sequence types, which can be implemented by custom classes.
