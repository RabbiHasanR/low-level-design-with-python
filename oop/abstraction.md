Abstraction in Python
Abstraction is one of the four fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), alongside encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Abstraction involves hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the necessary and relevant aspects. It allows you to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it.

Key Concepts of Abstraction
Hiding Complexity: Abstraction helps in hiding the complex implementation details and only shows the essential features of an object.
Interfaces and Abstract Classes: In Python, abstraction is typically implemented using abstract classes and interfaces. These define methods that must be implemented by derived classes, without specifying the details of the method implementations.
Real-Life Analogy: Consider a car. You only need to know how to drive it (steering, acceleration, braking), but you don't need to understand how the engine works internally. The car's interface is abstracted for the driver.


Implementing Abstraction in Python
In Python, abstraction is achieved through the use of abstract base classes (ABCs) from the abc module. An abstract class can have one or more abstract methods, which are methods declared but not implemented in the base class. Concrete subclasses of this abstract class must implement all the abstract methods.
