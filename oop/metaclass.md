Metaclasses in Python OOP
A metaclass in Python is a class of a class, meaning it defines the behavior of classes themselves. Just as classes define how instances of those classes behave, metaclasses define how classes behave. Essentially, a metaclass allows you to control the creation, modification, and behavior of classes.

In Python, everything is an object, including classes. A class is an instance of a metaclass. By default, the metaclass for all classes in Python is type, which is itself a metaclass.

Key Concepts of Metaclasses
Class of a Class: A metaclass is a class that defines or customizes the behavior of other classes.
Class Creation Hook: Metaclasses allow you to hook into the class creation process, which means you can modify class attributes, add methods, enforce constraints, and more.
type: The default metaclass in Python is type. When you create a class, Python internally uses type to create it.
Custom Metaclasses: You can define your own metaclasses to control the creation and behavior of classes.
When to Use Metaclasses
Metaclasses are considered an advanced feature in Python and are typically used when you need to create frameworks or libraries that require a high level of customization or control over class behavior. They are rarely needed in everyday programming.


Built-In Example: ABCMeta in the abc Module
The abc (Abstract Base Class) module in Python uses a metaclass called ABCMeta to define abstract base classes. Abstract base classes are classes that cannot be instantiated directly and are intended to be subclassed. They may define abstract methods that must be implemented by any concrete subclass.

How Metaclasses Work
Class Definition: When you define a class, Python internally calls the metaclass to create the class object. By default, this is handled by type, but you can specify a custom metaclass by using the metaclass keyword in the class definition.

Custom Metaclass Creation: You create a custom metaclass by inheriting from type and overriding methods like __new__ or __init__ to control class creation.



Summary
Metaclass: A class of a class, controlling how classes are created and behaved.
Use Cases: Metaclasses are useful in scenarios requiring advanced class behavior customization, such as enforcing class constraints, implementing design patterns (e.g., Singleton), or creating abstract base classes.
type: The default metaclass in Python, responsible for creating all classes.
Real-Life Example: Enforcing method implementation in a class hierarchy, as demonstrated by the SaveMethodEnforcer metaclass.
Built-In Example: The ABCMeta metaclass in the abc module, which is used to create abstract base classes.
