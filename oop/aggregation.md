Aggregation in OOP
Aggregation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that represents a relationship between two classes where one class is a part of another class, but they have a loose coupling. Aggregation is a type of association that represents a "whole-part" relationship, but unlike composition, the "part" (or constituent object) can exist independently of the "whole" (or container object).

Key Concepts of Aggregation
"Has-a" Relationship: Like composition, aggregation also represents a "has-a" relationship, but the life cycles of the objects involved are different.
Loose Coupling: In aggregation, the objects involved are loosely coupled, meaning that the lifecycle of the "part" is independent of the "whole". The "part" can exist even when the "whole" is destroyed.
Reusability: Since the "part" can exist independently, it can be reused across different "whole" objects.
Aggregation vs. Composition
Composition: In composition, the "part" (constituent object) is entirely dependent on the "whole". If the "whole" is destroyed, the "part" is also destroyed. For example, a Car has an Engine, and if the Car is destroyed, the Engine is typically destroyed as well.
Aggregation: In aggregation, the "part" can exist independently of the "whole". For example, a Library has Books, but if the Library is closed or destroyed, the Books can still exist and be part of another Library.


Advantages of Aggregation
Independence: The "part" (constituent object) can exist independently of the "whole" (container object), providing more flexibility in object management.
Reusability: Aggregated objects can be shared across different "whole" objects, reducing redundancy and promoting reuse.
Maintainability: Changes to the "part" don't necessarily affect the "whole", making the system easier to maintain and evolve.
Real-Life Use Cases for Aggregation
Library and Books: As demonstrated in the example, a Library aggregates Books, but the Books can exist outside the Library.
Company and Employees: A Company aggregates Employees, but the Employees can leave the Company and still exist.
School and Students: A School aggregates Students, but the Students can transfer to another School or exist independently.



Summary
Aggregation: A design principle where a class is associated with one or more objects of other classes, representing a "whole-part" relationship. The key characteristic of aggregation is that the "part" can exist independently of the "whole".
Real-Life Example: A Library aggregates Books. The Books can exist independently of the Library and can be shared across multiple libraries.
Comparison with Composition: Unlike composition, where the "part" is entirely dependent on the "whole", aggregation allows the "part" to exist independently, promoting loose coupling and reusability.
Advantages: Aggregation promotes independence, reusability, and maintainability, making it a powerful concept in designing flexible and scalable systems.
