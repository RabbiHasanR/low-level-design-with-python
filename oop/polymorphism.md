Polymorphism in Python: An Overview
Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that refers to the ability of different objects to respond to the same method in a way that is specific to their type. The term "polymorphism" is derived from Greek, meaning "many forms." In Python, polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling the same operation to be applied to objects of different types.

Types of Polymorphism
Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism): Different classes can define methods with the same name, and the correct method is called based on the object type at runtime.
Method Overloading (Compile-time Polymorphism): Though Python doesn't support method overloading (as in some other languages like Java), it achieves a similar effect through default arguments or by handling different types within a method.
Operator Overloading: Python allows operators to be used in ways that are specific to the objects they are applied to (e.g., using + to add two numbers or concatenate two strings).


Summary
Polymorphism: A key concept in OOP that allows objects of different classes to respond to the same method or operation in a way that is specific to their type.
Method Overriding: A common form of polymorphism where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.
Operator Overloading: Allows operators to have different meanings based on the types of objects they operate on, enabling polymorphism in arithmetic and other operations.
Method Overloading (Simulated in Python): Achieved through default arguments and type checking inside a method, allowing the same method to handle different types of inputs.
Abstract Base Classes (ABC): Used to define a common interface that must be implemented by subclasses, enforcing polymorphism.
