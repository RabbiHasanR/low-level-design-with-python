Class: A blueprint for creating objects (instances). It defines a set of attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class can use.

Object is the actual entity stored in memory with attributes and methods.

Instance refers to the relationship between that object and its class. It emphasizes that the object is a concrete example of a class.
