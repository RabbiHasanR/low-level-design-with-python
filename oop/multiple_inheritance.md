Multiple Inheritance in Python
Multiple inheritance is a feature in object-oriented programming where a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. In Python, a class can directly inherit from multiple classes, making it possible to combine the functionality of multiple parent classes into a single child class.

How Multiple Inheritance Works
When a class inherits from multiple parent classes, it gains access to all the attributes and methods from each of those classes. Python uses a method resolution order (MRO) to determine the order in which the parent classes are searched when a method or attribute is accessed. Pythonâ€™s MRO follows the C3 linearization algorithm.


Method Resolution Order (MRO)
In the case of multiple inheritance, Python determines which method to call by looking at the method resolution order (MRO). The MRO is the order in which Python looks for a method in the hierarchy of classes. You can inspect the MRO of a class using the mro() method or the __mro__ attribute.


Diamond Problem
One of the complexities of multiple inheritance is the diamond problem, where a class inherits from two classes that both inherit from a common superclass. This can lead to ambiguity about which version of a method should be called.

super() in Python: An Overview
super() is a built-in Python function that allows you to call methods from a parent (or superclass) in a child (or subclass) class. It's most commonly used in the context of inheritance, where you have a child class that extends the behavior of a parent class.

Why Use super()?
Access Parent Class Methods: It provides a way to explicitly call a method from the parent class, even if you've overridden that method in the child class.
Avoid Hardcoding Parent Class Names: super() helps avoid explicitly naming the parent class, making your code more maintainable and flexible, especially in the context of multiple inheritance.
Support for Multiple Inheritance: In complex inheritance hierarchies, super() helps ensure that the right method is called according to the method resolution order (MRO).

Summary
Multiple Inheritance: Allows a class to inherit from more than one parent class, combining their functionalities.
MRO (Method Resolution Order): Python determines the order in which methods are inherited and executed using MRO.
Diamond Problem: A potential issue in multiple inheritance where ambiguity arises in method resolution; Python resolves this using MRO.
Real-World Use Case: Useful for combining functionalities from different classes, like logging, database operations, or interfaces.
