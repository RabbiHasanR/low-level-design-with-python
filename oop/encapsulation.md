Encapsulation: A fundamental OOP concept that involves bundling data and methods within a class and restricting access to some of the class's components.
Public Attributes: Accessible from anywhere.
Protected Attributes: Indicated by a single underscore _; intended for internal use but still accessible outside.
Private Attributes: Indicated by a double underscore __; access is restricted, and Python applies name mangling to make direct access harder.
Encapsulation in Practice: Use private attributes to protect sensitive data and provide public methods to access and modify that data if needed.
Encapsulation helps ensure that an objectâ€™s internal state cannot be directly accessed or modified from outside the class, which helps maintain data integrity and prevents unintended side effects.
